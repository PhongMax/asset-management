## React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is the core of our template. If you don't know what React is or don't know how to use it, we strongly recommend checking the React before start doing anything with Oftadeh.

## Create React App (CLI)

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is a tool built by developers at Facebook to help you build React applications. It saves you from time- consuming setup and conguration.

## Prerequisites

This section will give you some information about what tools you will need.

### Node.js

To install and use Oftadeh React, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to your computer. We won't get into too much detail about Node.js as it's out of the scope of this documentation. Also you won't need to actually use Node.js, it's only required for the development process.

## Installation

**A.Installing Prerequisites**
<br />
Download and install at least LTS or the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) from its web site.

**B.Installing Oftadeh React**
<br />
Open your favorite console application (Terminal, Command Prompt etc.), navigate into your work folder, run the following command and wait for it to finish:
<br />

`npm install`

<br />
This command will install all the required Node.js modules into the node_modules directory inside your work folder.

<br />
And now, you are ready to run the Oftadeh React for the first time.

### Development

While still in your work folder, run the following command in the console application:
<br />

`npm start`

<br />
And that's it. create-react-app will take care everything and start the Oftadeh React.

<br />
You can check out your console application to get further information about the server. By default, it will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) but it might change depending on your setup

### Production

The following command builds the application into an output directory

<br />

`npm run build`

<br />

compiles the application into /build directory

### Deployment

Checkout at Facebook's create-react-app documentation:[Deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
